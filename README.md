# Basic-Genetic-Algorithm-Implementation
 A basic genetic algorithm implementation intended as a baseline design for a larger project.

# Components of a Genetic Algorithm
 Population
 - Set of candidate solutions, also called individuals
 - Represented as a "chromosome" which can be coded as, binary strings, arrays, or other data structures
 - In this implementation, each chromosome represents a set of input values
 Fitness Function
 - Evalutes each individual's ability to solve the problem
 - In certain
